## Gingerbar!

A UI-only resource pack for now, that mostly gingerbread-ifies your interface, with some icing on top! Still far from finished though :(.

Currently, as far as GUI containers go, only crafting tables, furnaces, survival/creative inventories and chests are textured.

Works with only 1.21.2->latest for now! (technically also older versions, however tooltips aren't textured in 1.21.1 and older for e.g.)
